Last Updated: December 2023

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how the Planyway Calendar Sync Extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

## Data Collection and Usage
The extension:
- Does NOT collect or store any personal information
- Does NOT track user behavior or analytics
- Does NOT maintain any databases of user information
- Only processes task data temporarily in memory to create calendar events

### Information Processing
The extension temporarily processes:
- Task titles and times from Planyway
- Task label colors
- Your Google Calendar event data (only during event creation)

This information is only used to create calendar events and is never stored or transmitted elsewhere.

## Data Storage
- No user data is stored locally or in the cloud
- No cookies are used
- No user preferences are saved

## Third-Party Services
The extension interacts with:

   - Used only for creating calendar events
   - Authentication handled through Google's secure OAuth system
2. Planyway
   - Only reads task information from the current page
   - No data is sent back to Planyway

## Permissions
The extension requires these permissions:
- `identity` and `identity.email`: For Google account authentication
- `storage`: For managing authentication tokens
- `activeTab`: To interact with Planyway task modals
- `scripting`: To inject the "Add to Calendar" button

These permissions are used solely for core functionality.

## Data Security
- All communication with Google Calendar uses secure HTTPS
